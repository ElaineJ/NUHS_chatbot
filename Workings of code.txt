How the code works

The chatbot is started by initializing the startprocess() function

Misc:
All question askings add /n for spacing
for most question depending on yes and no they are made into different functions with if/else called writesomething
When there is a redflag, the redflag function will be called and the redflag message will be printed in the function


Dialogue flow:
The different set of questions depending on conditions are in the functions
Operation questions like circumcision and billary drainage are in interpreter file
Condition questions are in Condition questions

Rules for recording:
All records are open and closed in the startprocess function only, though writing is done in the other functions.
